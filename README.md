# cnn_model
a collection of cnn_networks worked by me
mnist_nn: the original cnn mnist program from tensorflow official tutorial, plus one function written by me to print out the outpuit after fist layers (32*14*14)
mnist_imitation: to get familar with the usage of tensorflow functions and structure, I re wrote the above file without use of any self built function
